<p class="p3"> <strong> <em> It's been a 10 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone made its way to theaters. Harry Potter has been through a lot with his two best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. There has been adventure, heartbreak, and even death, all the elements that have shaped Harry into the man he needs to be to face the dark and evil wizard Lord Volemort. Now with the final installment of the Harry Potter movie franchise, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, coming to theaters on July 15, maybe some people need a little refresher of the events that have lead Harry Potter to this epic and final battle. We all know the classic battle of book vs movie, of which one is better and how the books have more details, but although I've read the books religiously since they came out, I will stick to the movie franchise. I will give a brief summary of the events that transpire in each of the movies so that those that will go see the last installment won't be lost and can fully enjoy the incredible epicness that is the Harry Potter series </em> </strong> </p>

Holmes is assisted by his flatmate and friend, Dr John Watson (Martin Freeman), who has returned from military service in Afghanistan with the Royal Army Medical Corps. Although Metropolitan Police Service Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves) and others are at first suspicious of Holmes, over time his exceptional intellect and bold powers of observation persuade them of his value. In part through Watson's blog documenting their adventures, Holmes becomes a reluctant celebrity with the press reporting on his cases and eccentric personal life. Both ordinary people and the British government ask for his help. </em> </strong> </p>

<p class="p11"> It was released in the United States on March 31, 2017. </p>
<p class="p12"> <strong> <em> The Boss Baby is a hilariously universal story about how a new baby's arrival impacts a family, told from the point of view of a delightfully unreliable narrator, a wildly imaginative 7 year old named Tim. With a sly, heart-filled message about the importance of family, DreamWorks' The Boss Baby is an authentic and broadly appealing original comedy for all ages. </em> </strong> </p>
